# Final-Project

We're very excited to get started on our Final Project! Below is our communication protocol and also a description of our selected topic. 

### Communication Protocol:

Our group has agreed that slack and zoom will be our primary methods of communication. We will use slack to ask questions while working on solo work, provide status updates, and also to plan any meetups outside of class. We will set up zoom meetings whenever we need to meet outside of class time. 

### Selected topic:

We've selected Fake News as the topic for our final project. 'Fake News' is defined as misleading or false information presented as a real piece of news. 

### Reason why we selected this topic:
We're interested in fake news given the current political climate and the recent increase in fake news. Social media has also made fake news more prevalent and easy to circulate to media consumers. We figured this topic would allow us to pick from many data sources and be intersting to research. 

### Data Source: 
We found a data set from Kaggle which contains over 2,000 news articles that have been classified as real or fake. The data set is easily downloaded as a csv file which will add to our database.

### Questions we want to answer with the data: 

- How likely a piece of news is to be fake or real based on different criteria like; Author, Title, Text, Type, etc. 

- Do certain criteria inputs have a higher likelihood of predicting whether a piece of news is real or fake?
